## Refactoring Log: main.py

### Observations:
1. **File Structure**: The main.py script is overloaded, handling configuration, logging, DHT discovery, cryptography, and more in one place.
2. **Inline Modules**: Inline definitions (e.g., config_schema, pqsig) should be standalone modules.
3. **Documentation**: The lack of clear documentation for top-level classes/methods impacts maintainability.

### Refactor Plan:
1. **Modularization**:
    - Split into modules: config, crypto, discovery, and utility.
    - Ensure reusability across the project.

2. **Documentation Pending**:
    - All public methods/classes need docstrings.
    - prepare Config schemas by YAML.
